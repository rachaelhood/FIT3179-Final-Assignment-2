            Each country is shaded on a blue scale by the number of recorded shark attacks in that year, darker = more incidents. Values are aggregated by country, so nations with long, surf-active coastlines may appear darker. Hover to see the exact country and count.

            <h3>What the map shows</h3>
            <p>In <strong> 2018</strong> shark attacks were heavily concentrated in a few key coastal regions, as shown on the map above. The darkest blue areas, <strong>Australia</strong> and the <strong> United States</strong>, recorded the highest number of incidents, reflecting their long coastlines and high levels of ocean activity. Moderate numbers occurred in <strong>Brazil, South Africa and New Zealand,</strong> while most other countries reported few or none. Overall, the map highlights how <strong>shark attacks in 2018 were unevenly distributed </strong>, clustering in warm, coastal environments where both sharks and humans are most active.</p>
            <p>In <strong> 2019</strong>, shark attacks again clustered in a few coastal nations. The <strong> United States and Australia</strong> show the darkest blues, indicating the highest incident counts, with smaller but noticeable activity in <strong> South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, and New Zealand.</strong> Much of <strong> Europe and Asia</strong> remain pale or blank, reflecting minimal reports. Overall, the 2019 pattern mirrors 2018, where attacks are <strong>unevenly distributed</strong>, concentrated where warm-water coastlines and high ocean use overlap.</p>

              <h2>Shark Attacks by Activity Type</h2>

              <p>In <strong> 2018</strong>, most shark attacks occurred during high-contact water activities. 
                <strong> Surfing</strong> saw by far the most incidents, followed by <strong> swimming and fishing</strong>. 
                Smaller numbers were linked to activities like <strong> spearfishing, wading and diving.</strong>
                This suggests that the <strong> greater the time spent in surf zones or near the water’s surface,</strong> the higher the likelihood of encountering a shark.</p>

              <p>In <strong> 2019</strong>, most shark attacks occurred during <strong> surfing</strong>, followed by <strong> swimming and fishing</strong>. 
                Smaller numbers were linked to <strong>snorkeling and spearfishing.</strong>
                Overall, attacks were most common in <strong> surface-level water sports</strong>, where people spend more time in active ocean areas.</p>

            <p>
              In <strong>both 2018 and 2019</strong>, shark-attack incidents cluster overwhelmingly at <strong>one attack</strong> per country-age group, with smaller secondary clusters at <strong>two</strong>, and only occasional points at <strong> three</strong>, mainly in high-exposure countries. 
              The <strong>modal ages sit in the late-teens to 30s</strong>, consistent with the group most active in surf and open-water sports, 
              2019 shows a slightly <strong> wider spread into the 40-60+ ranges</strong>. Bubble size (population) highlights the <strong>United States</strong> and to a lesser extent <strong>Australia</strong> as the largest contributors to total incidents, 
              reflecting exposure rather than per-capita risk. Overall, the pattern is <strong>stable across years</strong>, attacks concentrate where coastal populations and ocean recreation are high,  with age skewed toward active adult cohorts.
